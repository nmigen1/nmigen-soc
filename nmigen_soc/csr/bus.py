class CSRMultiplexer(Elaboratable):
    """CPU-side CSR interface.

    A low-level interface to a set of peripheral CSR registers that implements address-based
    multiplexing and atomic updates of wide registers.

    Operation
    ---------

    The CSR multiplexer splits each CSR register into chunks according to its data width. Each
    chunk is assigned an address, and the first chunk of each register always has the provided
    minimum alignment. This allows accessing CSRs of any size using any datapath width.

    When the first chunk of a register is read, the value of a register is captured, and reads
    from subsequent chunks of the same register return the captured values. When any chunk except
    the last chunk of a register is written, the written value is captured; a write to the last
    chunk writes the captured value to the register. This allows atomically accessing CSRs larger
    than datapath width.

    Reads to padding bytes return zeroes, and writes to padding bytes are ignored.

    Writes are registered, and add 1 cycle of latency.

    Wide registers
    --------------

    Because the CSR bus conserves logic and routing resources, it is common to e.g. access
    a CSR bus with an *n*-bit data path from a CPU with a *k*-bit datapath (*k>n*) in cases
    where CSR access latency is less important than resource usage. In this case, two strategies
    are possible for connecting the CSR bus to the CPU:
        * The CPU could access the CSR bus directly (with no intervening logic other than simple
          translation of control signals). In this case, the register alignment should be set
          to 1, and each *w*-bit register would occupy *ceil(w/n)* addresses from the CPU
          perspective, requiring the same amount of memory instructions to access.
        * The CPU could also access the CSR bus through a width down-converter, which would issue
          *k/n* CSR accesses for each CPU access. In this case, the register alignment should be
          set to *k/n*, and each *w*-bit register would occupy *ceil(w/k)* addresses from the CPU
          perspective, requiring the same amount of memory instructions to access.

    If alignment is greater than 1, it affects which CSR bus write is considered a write to
    the last register chunk. For example, if a 24-bit register is used with a 8-bit CSR bus and
    a CPU with a 32-bit datapath, a write to this register requires 4 CSR bus writes to complete
    and the 4th write is the one that actually writes the value to the register. This allows
    determining write latency solely from the amount of addresses the register occupies in
    the CPU address space, and the width of the CSR bus.

    Parameters
    ----------
    addr_width : int
        Address width. At most ``(2 ** addr_width) * data_width`` register bits will be available.
    data_width : int
        Data width. Registers are accessed in ``data_width`` sized chunks.
    alignment : int
        Register alignment. The address assigned to each register will be a multiple of
        ``2 ** alignment``.

    Attributes
    ----------
    addr : Signal(addr_width)
        Address for reads and writes.
    r_data : Signal(data_width)
        Read data. Valid on the next cycle after ``r_stb`` is asserted.
    r_stb : Signal()
        Read strobe. If ``addr`` points to the first chunk of a register, captures register value
        and causes read side effects to be performed (if any). If ``addr`` points to any chunk
        of a register, latches the captured value to ``r_data``. Otherwise, latches zero
        to ``r_data``.
    w_data : Signal(data_width)
        Write data. Must be valid when ``w_stb`` is asserted.
    w_stb : Signal()
        Write strobe. If ``addr`` points to the last chunk of a register, writes captured value
        to the register and causes write side effects to be performed (if any). If ``addr`` points
        to any chunk of a register, latches ``w_data`` to the captured value. Otherwise, does
        nothing.
